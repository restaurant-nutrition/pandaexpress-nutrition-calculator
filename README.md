## How to Calculate Your Meal Nutrition

Calculating your total meal nutrition is straightforward. Simply add up the calories and macros from each item you're eating.

### Basic Formula

```
Total Calories = Entree Calories + Side Calories + Sauce Calories + Beverage Calories
```

**Example:**

You order Orange Chicken with Fried Rice and Teriyaki Sauce:

```
Orange Chicken:     380 calories
Fried Rice:         520 calories
Teriyaki Sauce:      70 calories
─────────────────────────────────
Total Meal:         970 calories
```

### Calculating Macros

Use the same approach for protein, carbs, and fat:

```
Total Protein = Entree Protein + Side Protein + Sauce Protein
Total Carbs = Entree Carbs + Side Carbs + Sauce Carbs
Total Fat = Entree Fat + Side Fat + Sauce Fat
```

**Example:**

Your Orange Chicken meal breakdown:

```
Protein:  14g (chicken) + 12g (rice) + 0g (sauce) = 26g protein
Carbs:    45g (chicken) + 82g (rice) + 16g (sauce) = 143g carbs
Fat:      18g (chicken) + 16g (rice) + 0g (sauce) = 34g fat
```

### Daily Calorie Budget Formula

If you're tracking daily calories, use this formula:

```
Remaining Calories = Daily Budget - Meal Calories
```

**Example:**

Your daily budget is 2,000 calories. You eat a 970-calorie meal:

```
Remaining: 2,000 - 970 = 1,030 calories left for the day
```

## Protein Efficiency Formula

To find the best protein-to-calorie ratio, use this formula:

```
Protein Efficiency = (Protein in grams ÷ Calories) × 100
```

**Example Comparison:**

Grilled Teriyaki Chicken:
```
(36g ÷ 300 calories) × 100 = 12% protein efficiency
```

Orange Chicken:
```
(14g ÷ 380 calories) × 100 = 3.7% protein efficiency
```

Higher percentages mean more protein per calorie, which is better for muscle building and satiety.

## Sodium Tracking

Fried Rice:          790mg sodium
Teriyaki Sauce:      380mg sodium
─────────────────────────────────
Total:             1,790mg sodium
```

**Daily Sodium Limit:** Most adults should stay under 2,300mg per day. One meal can easily exceed this.
